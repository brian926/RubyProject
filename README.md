Solving several different problems with Ruby. These problems are simple programming problems that are often used.

The Caesar Cipher takes a string and a integer and then shifts the letters in the string to the amount of the integer.

The Stock Picker takes an array of prices, the position of the array representing days. It then chooses the best day to buy and then the best day to sell.

The Substrings takes a string and array with certain words. Then it test if the words in the array, or dictionary, occurs in the string.

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array from smallest to largest. Due to how simple it is, it runs at O(n^2). The bubble_sort_by method sorts an array of strings by their length, from smallest to largest.

Enum creates a enumerable module which rebuilds some common methods that are often used in Ruby.
